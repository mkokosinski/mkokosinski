- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m MichaÅ‚ KokosiÅ„Å›ki, Web Developer
   I started my adventure with programming almost 4 years ago, for 2 years I have been loving front-end technologies. Since then, I have been researching ReactJS and its ecosystem. I have some commercial experience (about 4 months). I am a good teammate, curious by nature and constantly working on improving my skills.

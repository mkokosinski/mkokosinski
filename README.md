- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is MichaÅ‚. I am a Web Developer
   I started my adventure with programming almost 4 years ago, for 2 years I have been loving front-end technologies. Since then, I have been researching ReactJS and its ecosystem. I have some commercial experience (about 4 months). I am a good teammate, curious by nature and constantly working on improving my skills.
 
- âœ¨ I recommend checking out my last project: E-widencja: [Demo](https://mkokosinski.github.io/e-widencja/) | [Code](https://github.com/mkokosinski/e-widencja)
